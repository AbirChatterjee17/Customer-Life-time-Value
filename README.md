# Customer-Life-time-Value
Predict Customer Life-time Value for an Auto Insurance Company
## Objective:
For an Auto Insurance company, predict the customer life time value (CLV). CLV is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer. Because we don't know how long each customer relationship will be, we make a good estimate and state CLV as a periodic value — that is, we usually say “this customer's 12-month (or 24-month, etc) CLV is $x”.
## Suggested Approach:
-	Understand the variables in the data set and study about the Industry.
-	Create hypothesis and validate.
-	Identify the statistical model to use (compare pros / cons of different models before accepting a model to follow) 
-	Clean the data set.
-	Run Regression model.
-	Check which variables are significant by looking at p values and business reasons?
-	Do different tests like multicollinearity test, Homoscedasticity test, Normality test, Serial correlation, MAPE.
-	Mention goodness of fit statistics (R-square, adjusted R-squares).
